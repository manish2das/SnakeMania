        Snake is a sub-genre of action video games where the player maneuvers
        the end of a growing line, often themed as a snake. The player must keep
        the snake from colliding with both other obstacles and itself, which
        gets harder as the snake lengthens. It originated in the 1976 two-player
        arcade video game Blockade from Gremlin Industries where the goal is to
        survive longer than the other player. The concept evolved into a
        single-player variant where a snake gets longer with each piece of food
        eaten—often apples or eggs. The simplicity and low technical
        requirements of snake games have resulted in hundreds of versions—some
        of which have the word snake or worm in the title—for many platforms.
        1982's Tron arcade game, based on the film, includes snake gameplay for
        the single-player Light Cycle segment and some later snake games borrow
        the theme. After a version simply called Snake was preloaded on Nokia
        mobile phones in 1998, there was a resurgence of interest in snake games
        as it found a larger audience.
